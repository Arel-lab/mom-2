                                As an Education Assistant, I have gained invaluable experience working with special needs children, focusing on creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment. My role involved collaborating closely with teachers to tailor educational strategies that meet each child's unique needs, ensuring they receive personalized attention and support. I assisted with the implementation of Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), employing a variety of teaching methods to engage students and facilitate their understanding. My responsibilities also included providing emotional and behavioral support, fostering a positive and encouraging atmosphere that promotes confidence and independence. Through this experience, I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills, enabling me to effectively address the diverse challenges and needs of special needs students. </p>
